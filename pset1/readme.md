The answer file for the egg problem (which is usually the coin problem) contains three implementations:
1. A greedy algorithm.
2. A bottoms up approach.
3. A top down apporoach.

The greedy algorithm is significantly faster, as the timing shows.
I do not understand exactly why my implematation of the top down algo works, and why it needs to set the <"target -1"> and not
just the <target>.
